# Hello 👋 my name is Paul

## Ph.D. Student | Software Developer | Veteran | Secret Clearance  
### 🖥️ Python | JavaScript | C | Embedded | 🤖 AI/ML | ⚙️ Systems Engineering

I'm a mostly self-taught developer with a stint at a bootcamp. I began my software journey in 2018 with Python and Django, building personal projects that eventually led me to a full-time career in software development. Since 2023, I've been developing and deploying professional full stack web applications used as internal tools for multiple companies.

### Embedded Engineering:

- [Raspberry Pi Bare Metal Programming](https://github.com/Johnny-Codes/bare-metal-pi) - This repository is the code of all the learning and programming I'm doing in C to be able to control my Raspberry Pi (FPGA).

- [Combining Bare Metal Programming with Web Development](https://github.com/Johnny-Codes/bare-metal-django) - A Django Web Server that controls my Raspberry Pi scripts from my bare-metal-pi repository. Runs on the RaspberryPi and exposes the Django server to my LAN so I can access the website from any device connected to my LAN. When I need a dopamine hit, I refresh the page and watch my LED blink :grinning:

### AI/ML Projects

- [AI Language Teacher](https://www.github.com/Johnny-Codes/ai-language-teacher) - An AI project that allows the user to have a conversation in a foreign language. Utilizes ChatGPT API, IBM Watson, TTS, and STT to help the user learn a foreign language.

- [Dungeon Master's Assistant](https://www.github.com/Johnny-Codes/dnd-dm-assistant) - Work in progress. Utilizing ChatGPT to help DM's create their worlds.

### Full Stack Applications

A lot of my Full Stack Applications are private because they're for paying customers but I'll list what I can.

- [Pet Project](https://www.github.com/Johnny-Codes/pet-project) - the beginning of a project management app with the intent to gamify finishing tasks and projects

- [AutoPlus](https://www.github.com/Johnny-Codes/autoplus) - A demo of a full stack application for managing a car dealership.
