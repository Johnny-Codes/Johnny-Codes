# Hello, I'm Paul Johns 👋

### Software Developer | Leader | Veteran

I am a Software Developer and leader with a proven history of building, deploying, and managing complex, real-world applications from concept to production.

My experience isn't just academic; I am the founder and developer of a live, deployed business and event directory, managing everything from the backend architecture to production DevOps and go-to-market strategy. I have architected and built multi-tenant SaaS platforms from scratch using modern, decoupled stacks (React, TypeScript, Django REST Framework) and have engineered complex, high-value API integrations with Stripe, OpenAI (GPT-4), and PCGS.

This hands-on technical expertise is built on a 13+ year foundation of leadership and strategic planning in U.S. Army Special Operations. My military career was not just about leading teams; it was about data analysis, managing multi-million dollar programs, and executing complex plans in high-stakes environments. I am the person who can both architect the system and lead the team to get it done.

I am actively seeking a Full-Stack or Backend Software Developer role where I can leverage my unique blend of technical architecture, product ownership, and leadership to build and scale impactful solutions.
