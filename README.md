# Hello :wave:  my name is Paul

## Software Developer | Veteran | Secret Clearance

I'm a mostly self-taught developer with a stint at a bootcamp. I started working with Python and Django in 2018. I developed personal projects on and off until early 2023 when I left my career in numismatics to begin a career as a Software Developer.

I've deployed several professional full stack web applications being used as internal tools for different companies.

Looking for opportunities in Huntsville, Al or remote work.

- :brain: Always learning and growing!

While I started with Python and Django, I have continued expanding my software knowledge. I've learned JavaScript and React to become a full stack developer creating seemless products for my customers. Furthermore, I'm beginning to learn C as part of my journey into Embedded Software Development. This has made me learn more things than I ever thought I'd be able to learn, like electrical engineering.
